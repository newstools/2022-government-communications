19 April 2022 The Government Communication and Information System (GCIS), is deeply saddened by the passing of one of our very own legendary communicator, Thabo Masebe. At the time of his passing, he served as the Acting Director-General in the Gauteng Premier's office. The GCIS extends it heartfelt condolences to the Masebe family, his colleagues and the province a large. Director General, Phumla Williams, said: “Masebe was known for his commitment and dedication to serving the people of South Africa. His passing is a great loss to the public service. He served with distinction and courage, and often went beyond the call of duty.” Masebe served more than 20 years in government, and in 2010 he joined the Presidency serving as spokesperson for the former Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe. Williams added, “He was an accomplished, multitalented, and resourceful public servant, who was well-known for his integrity. As communicators in the public service, we will remember and action the many lessons we have learnt from Thabo. We pray for strength for his family and friends.”
