28 February 2022 South Africa will host its fourth South Africa Investment Conference (SAIC) on 24 March 2022 at the Sandton Convention Centre in Johannesburg. The conference is part of our investment drive to attract R1.2 trillion over five years. The SAIC attracts delegates from South Africa and worldwide to discuss investment opportunities. Since the first investment conference in 2018, South Africa has attracted R770 billion in commitments across a wide range of economic sectors. The SAIC occurs as the country emerges from the fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and a further opening of social and economic activities. The conference follows the 2022 State of the Nation Address that sent a strong message that the country is open for business, and in partnership with industry, we can create the environment for business to flourish and create jobs. The SAIC will profile the strengths and comparative advantages South Africa offers investors and trade partners in a period of growing African integration through the African Continental Free Trade Area.
