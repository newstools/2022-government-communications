09 February 2022 President Ramaphosa to deliver the State of the Nation Address President Cyril Ramaphosa will tomorrow evening, 10 February 2022, deliver the State of the Nation Address to a Joint Sitting of Parliament and the nation at 19:00. The address will take place in a hybrid form from the Cape Town City Hall following the damage by fire to Parliament on Sunday, 02 January 2022. Since the advent of democracy in 1994, the President of the Republic has annually called for a joint sitting of the National Assembly and National Council of Provinces, to provide an overview of current developments in the country and to set out government’s key plans for the year ahead. The State of the Nation Address is an opportunity for the President to take stock of challenges faced by the nation but also of progress made. The ceremonial content of the day will again highlight the mutual regard and partnership among the three arms of the state, in line with the Constitutional vision. The Address embraces all South Africans and all sectors of society, and reflects the lived experience of all South Africans, regardless of background or political orientation. It also focuses the minds and energies of all South Africans on the values that bind the nation together and on the actions needed to build and sustain our shared future. President Ramaphosa has called on South Africans to take an active interest in the State of the Nation Address so that they can play their part in helping South Africa grow.
