25 March The Government Communication and Information System welcomes the judgement issued by the Johannesburg High Court judge Stuart Wilson on Ntuthuko Shoba, who was found guilty of orchestrating the murder of his late girlfriend, Tshegofatso Pule. Government is confident that this judgement will serve as a strong lesson and deterrent to future perpetrators. Government is dedicated to fighting the scourge of Gender-based Violence and Femicide (GBVF) in the country. Earlier this year President Cyril Ramaphosa signed into law three pieces of legislation to address the violence and abuse of women and children. This was a major step forward in our efforts to fight the scourge of violence. GCIS Director General, Phumla Williams, said: “We must collectively act to prevent abuse and to ensure a safer society for women and children. We call on all South Africans to work together with police, prosecutors and courts to ensure that perpetrators of gender-based violence are brought to book. It is the responsibility of all South Africans to end the culture of silence on gender-based violence and create safer communities.” Report all cases of rape, sexual assault or any form of violence to a local police station or call the toll-free Crime Stop number: 086 00 10111. Victims of violence are encouraged to use the 24-Hour Gender-Based Violence Command Centre hotline to report any abuse. The toll-free number is 0800 428 428.
