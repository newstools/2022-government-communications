12 May Media arrangements South Africa will together with the International Labour Organisation host the Fifth Global Conference on the Elimination of Child Labour from 15–20 May 2022 in Durban. The conference brings together stakeholders from the around the world to discuss, share good practices, advance policies and commit to the elimination of child labour. The conference will build on four previous Global Conferences, held in Buenos Aires (2017), Brasilia (2013), The Hague (2010), and Oslo (1997), which raised awareness of the issue, mobilised resources and established a strategic direction for the global movement against child labour. The 5th instalment of this global conference is being hosted in Africa for the first time. South Africa's hosting of the conference is consistent with SDG 8.7, which calls for the abolition of all forms of child labour by 2025 and the abolition of forced labour, modern slavery, and human trafficking by 2030. The Government of South Africa and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) is hosting this important conference as solidarity to KwaZulu –Natal following the devastating floods that claimed more than 400 lives.
