11 January 2022 The South African media are invited to submit their entries for the 2022 SADC Media Awards competition. The SADC Media Awards are open to journalists from the SADC Member States. The first prize winners will receive their prizes and certificates on the margins of the 42nd SADC Summit of Heads of State and Government. The SADC Media Awards were established in 1996 to recognise best media work in disseminating information on SADC to support the process of regional co-operation and integration in the region. The first prize winner in each category receives US$2,500 and the runner-up receives US$1000. To promote regional integration and cooperation (cross-border issues), the awards aim to recognise excellence in journalism in the area of print, photo, television, radio as well as to encourage media practitioners in member states to cover issues pertaining to the region. Journalists who wish to enter the competition can access more information about the competition from the www.sadc.int and www.gcis.gov.za websites.
